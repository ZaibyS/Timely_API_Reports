In the extracted data from the API, the number of rows exceeds that of the provided sample file. This variance can be attributed to the following reasons:

1. Missing Users in the Sample File:
The sample file lacks rows corresponding to the following users:

* Deimante Altmanaite
* Mertcan Ozhabes
* Lina Laurynaite
* Tsitsi Maisuradze
* Santa Usenko

2. Data Exclusion for 'Leave' Clients:
Additionally, the sample file excludes data associated with clients labeled as 'Leave'. The absence of such entries contributes to the overall difference in row count between the provided sample and the complete data extracted from the API.
